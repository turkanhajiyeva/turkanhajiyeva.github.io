    <h1>Information About the Website Project</h1>
    <p> Our second group assignment is "The Website Project", 
      during this time we have learned a lot about creating and
       designing webpages. 
      We have learned three languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
       HTML and CSS was quite easy, however, we all struggled 
       with JavaScript a little bit. Nevertheless, it wasnâ€™t 
       impossible and we could all finish JavaScript. This was
        quite an interesting journey! We also arranged meetings
         weekly for this assignment to work together on this project,
          right now you can see the result of our work and also you 
          can see our progress on Codecademy by clicking links below:) </p>
