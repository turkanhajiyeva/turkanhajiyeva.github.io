        <p class="tu">My name is Turkan Hajiyeva. I am 17.
           My major is Comp-<br>uter Engineering and
            hopefully, I will graduate in 2025.
             In<br> my free time, which I don't have
              that often, I try to read mo-<br>re books
               or go outside with my friends, I also
                really like lis-<br>tening to music. My 
                favorite quote from the book I am 
                cur-<br>rently reading is "What is the 
                point of being alive if you do <br>not 
                at least try to do something remarkable?"
                 (John Green,<br> An abundance of Katherines, p.33). </p>
