    <h1>Hour of Code</h1>
    <p>     Our first group work assignment was to make a 'Hour of Code' event, the point of this 
        event is to teach children about programming in very simple way with graphic illustrations
        and simple coding games. We chose secondary school number 236, class 6C. We have arranged 
        our meetings every week to discuss and solve some problems about the event. The hard part 
        was the "negotiation" with chosen school as they were asking for documents, so this took us
        some time. Fortunately, it ended up successefully and we arranged the meeting for 6th of December.
        Firstly, we will begin our event with presentation about ADA university, then we will move on to 
        presentation and introduction about what we are exactly going to do with code.org and simple 
        introduction with programming. Then we will explain the first task and what students should 
        do with it. And if students have any questions, they should ask us and we will be more than 
        happy to assist them with anything that they need help with. After, we will help them with 
        anything they need.  Eljan will take pictures and videos of the event. Turkan will do the 
        introduction speech about the ADA university, Jeyla will take care of publishing. And we will
         all have a part in tutoring or helping the children with Hour Of Code, the same with report.
          We will all add something to the report. In the report, we will write about date, time, place 
          of the Hour of Code event,  studentsâ€™ struggles, commonly asked questions, what students liked
           or disliked about Hour of Code.</p>
